# 207. Course Schedule

# Idea:
# - since prereq has to come before main course, it is a DAG
# - problem can be reduced to -> detecting cycles
# - we can use DFS / Topological ordering to defect cycles

# Topological sorting:
# - aligning all nodes in a line in a way that all edges point to the right
# - only DAGs have topological sorting, because if cycle exists,
#   at least one edge will point in the other direction
# - useful when one thing needs to happen before another, ex: prereq, dependency, etc

# Kahn's algorithm:
# - remove nodes without dependency
# - after removing nodes, new nodes without dependency will appear
# - if not all nodes can be removed, cycle exists
# - indegree: number of dependencies
# Pseudocode:
# find all node's indegree
# add all nodes with 0 indegree to the queue
# pop a node from the queue, and reduce the indegree of node's children by 1
# repeat until queue is empty, if unexplored node exists, cycle exists

# DFS:
# - if a decendent is already being explored, there is a back edge, which means cycle exists
# - use 3 states to denote, not visited, visiting, and visited
# - each node explores it's descendants.
# - if any descendant is visited, don't explore again
# - if any descendant is being visited, cycle exists
# - update current node to visited after exploring all descendants
# - check if cycle exists starting every node.
