# 1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination

# Intuition:
# - finding shortest path -> use BFS
# - if there are multiple paths to the same cell, use path with higher k value, 
#   and to do that, k must be tracked.
# - pass steps so that it can be returned

# Stop exploring condition:
# - if out of bounds, don't explore
# - if not enough k, don't explore
# - if a previous path is better (has higher k), don't explore

# Time Complexity:
# - need to traverse the grid (M*N)
# - can explore the same cell up to k times (k)
# Total: O(M*N*k)

# Space Complexity:
# - need to store all cells (M*N)
# - lengh of queue is at worst holding all cells (M*N)
# Total: O(M*N)
